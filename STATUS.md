# Status

We intend to claim the **Artifacts Available** badge and the **Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable** badge for our replication package because:

1. **Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable**: We provide clear descriptions about how to download, setup, and use this replication package. All the scripts, data files, and databases are of high quality and clearly documented to facilitate re-use and re-purposing in future studies.
2. **Artifacts Available**: Both our dataset and this git repository has been premanently archived at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4816753)
