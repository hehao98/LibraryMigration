CVE-2013-7454,validator,CRITICAL,Multiple XSS Filter Bypasses in validator,"Versions of `validator` prior to 1.1.0 are affected by several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities due to bypasses discovered in the blacklist-based filter.


## Proof of Concept
Various inputs that could bypass the filter were discovered:

Improper parsing of nested tags:

```
<s <onmouseover=""alert(1)""> <;s onmouseover=""alert(1)"">This is a test</s>
```

Incomplete filtering of javascript: URIs:

```
<a href=""javascriptJ a V a S c R iPt::alert(1)"" ""<s>"">test</a>
```

UI Redressing:

```
<div style=""z-index: 9999999; background-color: green; width: 100%; height: 100%"">
<h1>You have won</h1>Please click the link and enter your login details:
<a href=""http://example.com/"">http://good.com</a>
</div>
```

Bypass via Nested Forbidden Strings:

```
<scrRedirecRedirect 302t 302ipt type=""text/javascript"">prompt(1);</scrRedirecRedirect 302t 302ipt>
```

Additional bypasses were discovered by Krzysztof Kotowicz in 2012 when auditing CodeIgniter's XSS filtering function, which this code was based off of.


## Recommendation

If you are a developer currently using the xss filter function from the validator package, you should consider replacing it with the escape filter function from the same package.

CVE-2016-10533,express-restify-mongoose,HIGH,Private Data Disclosure in express-restify-mongoose,"Affected versions of `express-restify-mongoose` are susceptible to an information leakage vulnerability which may allow an attacker to access fields on a model even if those fields are marked as private.


## Proof of Concept

If you have a user model that you want to protect, such as the following User model:
```
const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    password: String,
}));
```

You would normally do something such as:
```
restify.serve(router, User, {
    private: ['password'], // Set the password part of User as private, so outside people can't read it
})
```

This would hide the password field from people that send your application a `GET /User` and `GET /User/some-user-id` request. 

A malicious user can go to your application and send a request for `GET /User?distinct=password` and get all the passwords for all the users in the database, despite the field being set to private. This could be used for other private data, if the malicious user knew what was set as private for specific routes.

CVE-2014-9772,validator,HIGH,XSS Filter Bypass via Encoded URL in validator,"Versions of `validator` prior to 2.0.0 contained an xss filter method that is affected by several filter bypasses. This may result in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.


## Proof of Concept
The xss() function removes the word ""javascript"" when contained inside an attribute.

However, it does not properly handle cases where characters have been hex-encoded. 

As a result, it is possible to build an input that bypasses the filter but which the browser will accept as valid JavaScript.

For example:
```<a href=""jav&#x61;script:..."">abc</a>```
will render as:
```<a href=""javascript:..."">abc</a>```


## Recommendation

The package author has decided to remove the xss filter functionality in the latest version of this module. If this feature is not currently being used, you are not affected by the vulnerability. If it is being used, updating to the latest version of the module will break your application.

In order for affected users to mitigate this vulnerability, it is necessary to use an [alternative package](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=xss%20filter&page=1&ranking=optimal) that provides similar functionality.

This problem occurs because vulnerable versions of `http-signature` sign the contents of headers, but not the header names.

## Proof of Concept

Consider this to be the initial, untampered request:
```

CVE-2017-16224,st,MODERATE,Open Redirect in st,"st is a module for serving static files.

An attacker is able to craft a request that results in an `HTTP 301` (redirect) to an entirely different domain. 

A request for: `http://some.server.com//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` would result in a 301 to `//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` which most browsers treat as a proper redirect as `//` is translated into the current schema being used.

Mitigating factor: 

In order for this to work, `st` must be serving from the root of a server (`/`) rather than the typical sub directory (`/static/`) and the redirect URL will end with some form of URL encoded `..` (""%2e%2e"", ""%2e."", "".%2e"").

CVE-2016-10533,express-restify-mongoose,HIGH,Private Data Disclosure in express-restify-mongoose,"Affected versions of `express-restify-mongoose` are susceptible to an information leakage vulnerability which may allow an attacker to access fields on a model even if those fields are marked as private.


## Proof of Concept

If you have a user model that you want to protect, such as the following User model:
```
const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    password: String,
}));
```

You would normally do something such as:
```
restify.serve(router, User, {
    private: ['password'], // Set the password part of User as private, so outside people can't read it
})
```

This would hide the password field from people that send your application a `GET /User` and `GET /User/some-user-id` request. 

A malicious user can go to your application and send a request for `GET /User?distinct=password` and get all the passwords for all the users in the database, despite the field being set to private. This could be used for other private data, if the malicious user knew what was set as private for specific routes.

## Proof of Concept:

The following characters are not escaped properly: `>`,`;`,`{`,`}`

Bash has a neat but not well known feature known as ""Bash Brace Expansion"", wherein a sub-command can be executed without spaces by running it between a set of `{}` and using the `,` instead of ` ` to seperate arguments. Because of this, full command injection is possible even though it was initially thought to be impossible. 

```
   const quote = require('shell-quote').quote;

CVE-2016-10549,sails,HIGH,Broken CORS in sails,"Affected versions of `sails` have an issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This may allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through cross-site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy. 

## Mitigating Factors

This is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. 

The problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided, because at that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.


## Recommendation

Update to version 0.12.7 or later.

As this vulnerability is primarily a user error, the patch for the vulnerability will simply cause the application to write an error message to the console when a vulnerable configuration is used in a production environment.

Writing a proper CORS configuration is still the responsibility of the user, so it is necessary to check for the error message after installing the patch. Be sure you are not using `allRoutes: true` with `origin:'*'`, and that you uncomment `origin` and set it to a reasonable value. Ensure that if `origin` is set to `*` that you truly mean for all other websites to be able to make cross-domain requests to your API.

Likewise, ensure `credentials` is uncommented out and set to the appropriate value. Make sure to explicitly set which origins may request resources via CORS.",2019-02-18T23:40:10Z,< 0.12.7,0.12.7

CVE-2016-10556,sequelize,CRITICAL,SQL Injection in sequelize,"Affected versions of `sequelize` cast arrays to strings and fail to properly escape the resulting SQL statement, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.


## Proof of Concept
In Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server there is an issue where arrays are treated as strings and improperly escaped.

Example Query:
```
database.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)', {
  replacements: {
    names: directCopyOfUserInput
  }
});
```

If the user inputs the value of `:names` as:
```
[""test"", ""'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')""]
```

The resulting SQL statement will be:
```
SELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')
```

The static file server module included with GUN had a **serious vulnerability**:

 - Using `curl --path-as-is` allowed reads on any parent directory or files.

This did not work via the browser or via curl without as-is option.

 ### Fixed

This has been fixed since version `0.2019.416` and higher.

 ### Who Was Effected?

Most NodeJS users who use the default setup, such as:

 - `npm start`
 - `node examples/http.js`
 - `Heroku` 1-click-deploy
 - `Docker`
 - `Now`

If you have a custom NodeJS code then you are probably safe *unless* you have something like `require('http').createServer(Gun.serve(__dirname))` in it.

If you have not upgraded, it is **mandatory** or else it is highly likely your environment variables and AWS (or other) keys could be leaked.

 ### Credit

It was reported and fixed by [JK0N](https://github.com/amark/gun/pull/527), but I did not understand the `--path-as-is` condition.

### Impact
Clicking on smartbanner _View_ link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile 3rd parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner.

### Patches
`rel=""noopener""` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability.

### Workarounds
If you can not upgrade to `v1.14.1`:
1. Ensure _View_ link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams
2. If _View_ link is going to a 3rd party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=""noopener""` is imposed on all `target=""_blank""` links.

    Following combination of smartbanner meta tags can be used to achieve the above:

    ```html
    <meta name=""smartbanner:enabled-platforms"" content=""none"">
    <meta name=""smartbanner:include-user-agent-regex"" content=""Mobile.*Safari"">

The vulnerability, reported by GoSecure Inc, allows Remote Code Execution, if you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input.

* If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
* If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 1.0.1 of angular-expressions

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround might be either to : 

* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application

OR

* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput : 

```js
if (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :""'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {
      var result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);
}
else {
     result = undefined;
}
```

CVE-2019-20174,auth0-lock,MODERATE,"Placeholder property does not indicate HTML capable, could lead to inadvertent abuse","## Overview

Auth0 Lock version 11.20.4 and earlier did not properly sanitize the generated HTML code. Customers using the `additionalSignUpFields` customization option to add a checkbox to the sign-up dialog that are passing a `placeholder` property obtained from an untrusted source (e.g. a query parameter) could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) on their signup pages.

## Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

- You are using Auth0 Lock version 11.20.4 or earlier.
- You pass `additionalSignUpFields` as options when initializing Lock which includes a field of type `checkbox` whose `placeholder` value is obtained from an untrusted source.

An example of a vulnerable snippet is the following where the `placeholder` value is partially user-controlled by the `name` query parameter:

```javascript
<script>
    var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    var options = {
        auth: {
            redirectUrl: 'http://localhost:12345/callback',
            responseType: 'code',
            params: {
                scope: 'openid email',
            },
        },
        additionalSignUpFields: [{
            name: 'agree',
            type: 'checkbox',
            placeholder: ""I agree to Terms and Conditions for "" + params.get('name'),
        }],
    };
    var lock = new Auth0Lock('<CLIENT_ID>', '<TENANT_NAME>.auth0.com', options);
    lock.show({
        allowShowPassword: true,
        initialScreen: 'signUp',
    });
</script>
```

## How to fix that?

Developers using Auth0’s signin solution Lock need to upgrade to version 11.21.0 or later. Version 11.21.0 introduces two changes:

1. The existing `placeholder` property is now treated as plain text to mitigate the problem.
2. A new `placeholderHTML` property is introduced that indicates the level of control it provides and that it should be only supplied from trusted sources.

## Will this update impact my users?

This fix patches the Auth0 Lock widget and may require changes in application code, but it will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.

Developers using the `placeholder` property with HTML content from a trusted source should start using the `placeholderHTML` property to continue providing the same user experience.",2020-01-31T17:59:51Z,< 11.21.0,11.21.0

GHSA-vg44-fw64-cpjx,eth-ledger-bridge-keyring,HIGH,Incorrect Account Used for Signing,"### Impact

Anybody using this library to sign with a BIP44 account other than the first account may be affected. If a user is signing with the first account (i.e. the account at index `0`), or with the legacy MEW/MyCrypto HD path, they are not affected.

The vulnerability impacts cases where the user signs a personal message or transaction without first adding the account. This includes cases where the user has already added the account in a previous session (i.e. they added the account, reset the application, then signed something). The serialization/deserialization process does restore a previously added account, but it doesn&#39;t restore the index instructing the keyring to use that account for signing. As a result, after serializing then deserializing the keyring state, the account at index `0` is always used for signing even if it isn&#39;t the current account.

### Patches

This has been patched ([#14](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring/pull/14)) in version &gt;=0.2.1 of [`eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring), and in version &gt;=0.2.2 of [`@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring). Users are encouraged to migrate to the new package name.

### Workarounds

To work around this problem without updating, you should remove then re-add the account before use. As long as the account was added during the lifetime of that process, signing with that account should work correctly.

If consumers of the http-client:
  1. make an http request with an authorization header
  2. that request leads to a redirect (302) and
  3. the redirect url redirects to another domain or hostname 

The authorization header will get passed to the other domain.

Note that since this library is for actions, the GITHUB_TOKEN that is available in actions is generated and scoped per job with [these permissions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token).

The problem is fixed in 1.0.8 at [npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/http-client).  In 1.0.8, the authorization header is stripped before making the redirected request if the hostname is different.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in: the core parser and `media` plugin. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.9 or lower and TinyMCE 5.2.1 or lower.

### Patches
This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 4.9.10 and 5.2.2 by improved HTML parsing and sanitization logic.

### Workarounds
The workarounds available are:
- disable the media plugin and manually sanitize CDATA content (see below)
or
- upgrade to either TinyMCE 4.9.10 or TinyMCE 5.2.2

#### Example: Manually strip CDATA elements
```js
setup: function(editor) {

CVE-2020-4035,@nozbe/watermelondb,MODERATE,DoS via malicious record IDs in WatermelonDB,"## Impact

Medium severity 5.9 https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

A maliciously crafted record ID can exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability in iOS adapter implementation and cause the app to delete all or selected records from the database, generally causing the app to become unusable.

This may happen in apps that don't validate IDs (valid IDs are `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/`) and use Watermelon Sync or low-level `database.adapter.destroyDeletedRecords` method.

The integrity risk is low due to the fact that maliciously deleted records won't synchronize, so logout-login will restore all data, although some local changes may be lost if the malicious deletion causes the sync process to fail to proceed to push stage.

No way to breach confidentiality with this vulnerability is known. Full exploitation of SQL Injection is mitigated, because it's not possible to nest an insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite, and it's not possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There's also no known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively deleting records, because those records will not be synchronized.

It's theoretically possible that selective record deletion could cause an app to behave insecurely if lack of a record is used to make security decisions by the app.

- `924c7ae2a8d` commit id contains the patch

## Workarounds

1. Ensure that your backend service sanitizes record IDs sent in the `pull sync` endpoint, such that only IDs matching `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/` are returned. This could also be done in JavaScript `pullChanges` function passed to `synchronize()`
2. If you use `destroyDeletedRecords` directly, validate all IDs passed the same way

CVE-2020-7662,websocket-extensions,MODERATE,Regular Expression Denial of Service in websocket-extensions (NPM package),"### Impact

The ReDoS flaw allows an attacker to exhaust the server's capacity to process
incoming requests by sending a WebSocket handshake request containing a header
of the following form:

    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b=""\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...

That is, a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is
a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. The
parser takes exponential time to reject this header as invalid, and this will
block the processing of any other work on the same thread. Thus if you are
running a single-threaded server, such a request can render your service
completely unavailable.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 0.1.4.

### Workarounds

There are no known work-arounds other than disabling any public-facing
WebSocket functionality you are operating.

### Impact

If `subscriptions: false` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, there is no impact.  If implementors were not expecting validation rules to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable.  If `introspection: true` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user-provided validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) since there would be no expectation that introspection was disabled.

The enforcement of user-provided validation rules on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.  Similarly, disabling introspection on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.

> **Note:** Unless `subscriptions: false` is explicitly passed to the constructor parameters of `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, **subscriptions are enabled by default, whether or not there is a `Subscription` type present in the schema.**  As an alternative to upgrading to a patched version, see the _Workarounds_ section below to disable subscriptions if it is not necessary.

In cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is impacted** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipeline within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677-L726)). 

The omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77-L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).

**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.

### Affected packages

The bug existed in `apollo-server-core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo-server-express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo-server-core` for their subscriptions support are affected.  This includes the `apollo-server` package that automatically provides an Express server.

Therefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of affected packages includes: `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-azure-functions`, `apollo-server-cache-memcached`, `apollo-server-core`, `apollo-server-cloud-functions`, `apollo-server-cloudflare`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-fastify`, `apollo-server-hapi`, `apollo-server-koa`, `apollo-server-lambda`, and `apollo-server-micro`.

> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.

### Resolution

The problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the affected integration package (e.g., `apollo-server-express`) **and** the `apollo-server-core` package are both updated to the patched versions.  (The version numbers should both be  2.14.2.)

### Workarounds

Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.  If upgrading is not an option, subscriptions can be disabled with `subscriptions: false` to resolve the impact.  **Disabling subscriptions in this way will disable _all_ subscriptions support and the WebSocket transport**:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({

GHSA-w42g-7vfc-xf37,apollo-server-cache-memcached,MODERATE,Introspection in schema validation in Apollo Server,"We encourage all users of Apollo Server to read this advisory in its entirety to understand the impact.  The _Resolution_ section contains details on patched versions.

### Impact

If `subscriptions: false` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, there is no impact.  If implementors were not expecting validation rules to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable.  If `introspection: true` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user-provided validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) since there would be no expectation that introspection was disabled.

The enforcement of user-provided validation rules on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.  Similarly, disabling introspection on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.

> **Note:** Unless `subscriptions: false` is explicitly passed to the constructor parameters of `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, **subscriptions are enabled by default, whether or not there is a `Subscription` type present in the schema.**  As an alternative to upgrading to a patched version, see the _Workarounds_ section below to disable subscriptions if it is not necessary.

In cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is impacted** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipeline within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677-L726)). 

The omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77-L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).

**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.

### Affected packages

The bug existed in `apollo-server-core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo-server-express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo-server-core` for their subscriptions support are affected.  This includes the `apollo-server` package that automatically provides an Express server.

Therefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of affected packages includes: `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-azure-functions`, `apollo-server-cache-memcached`, `apollo-server-core`, `apollo-server-cloud-functions`, `apollo-server-cloudflare`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-fastify`, `apollo-server-hapi`, `apollo-server-koa`, `apollo-server-lambda`, and `apollo-server-micro`.

> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.

### Resolution

The problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the affected integration package (e.g., `apollo-server-express`) **and** the `apollo-server-core` package are both updated to the patched versions.  (The version numbers should both be  2.14.2.)

### Workarounds

Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.  If upgrading is not an option, subscriptions can be disabled with `subscriptions: false` to resolve the impact.  **Disabling subscriptions in this way will disable _all_ subscriptions support and the WebSocket transport**:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  subscriptions: false,
  /* Other options, such as typeDefs, resolvers, schema, etc. */
});

In cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is impacted** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipeline within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677-L726)). 

The omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77-L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).

**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.

### Affected packages

The bug existed in `apollo-server-core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo-server-express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo-server-core` for their subscriptions support are affected.  This includes the `apollo-server` package that automatically provides an Express server.

Therefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of affected packages includes: `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-azure-functions`, `apollo-server-cache-memcached`, `apollo-server-core`, `apollo-server-cloud-functions`, `apollo-server-cloudflare`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-fastify`, `apollo-server-hapi`, `apollo-server-koa`, `apollo-server-lambda`, and `apollo-server-micro`.

> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.

### Resolution

The problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the affected integration package (e.g., `apollo-server-express`) **and** the `apollo-server-core` package are both updated to the patched versions.  (The version numbers should both be  2.14.2.)

### Workarounds

Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.  If upgrading is not an option, subscriptions can be disabled with `subscriptions: false` to resolve the impact.  **Disabling subscriptions in this way will disable _all_ subscriptions support and the WebSocket transport**:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  subscriptions: false,
  /* Other options, such as typeDefs, resolvers, schema, etc. */
});
```

CVE-2020-4038,graphql-playground-html,HIGH,Reflected XSS in GraphQL Playground,"### Impact

**directly impacted:**

- `graphql-playground-html@<1.6.22` - all unsanitized user input for `renderPlaygroundPage()`

**all of our consuming packages** of `graphql-playground-html` are impacted:

- `graphql-playground-middleware-express@<1.7.16` - unsanitized user input to `expressPlayground()`
- `graphql-playground-middleware-koa@<1.6.15` - unsanitized user input to `koaPlayground()`
- `graphql-playground-middleware-lambda@<1.7.17` - unsanitized user input to `lambdaPlayground()`
- `graphql-playground-middleware-hapi@<1.6.13` - unsanitized user input to `hapiPlayground()`

as well as ***any other packages*** that use these methods with unsanitized user input.

**not impacted:**

- `graphql-playground-electron` - uses `renderPlaygroundPage()` statically for a webpack build for electron bundle, no dynamic user input
- `graphql-playground-react` - usage of the component directly in a react application does not expose reflected XSS vulnerabilities. only the demo in `public/` contains the vulnerability, because it uses an old version of the html pacakge.

### Patches

upgrading to the above mentioned versions will solve the issue.

If you're using `graphql-playground-html` directly, then:

```
yarn add graphql-playground-html@^1.6.22
```

or

```
npm install --save graphql-playground-html@^1.6.22
```

Then, similar steps need to be taken for each middleware:

- [Upgrade Express Middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-playground-middleware-express#security-upgrade-steps)
- [Upgrade Koa Middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-playground-middleware-koa#security-upgrade-steps)
- [Upgrade Lambda Middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-playground-middleware-lambda#security-upgrade-steps)
- [Upgrade Hapi Middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-playground-middleware-hapi#security-upgrade-steps)

### Workarounds

Ensure you properly sanitize *all* user input for options you use for whatever function to initialize GraphQLPlayground:

for example, with `graphql-playground-html` and express:

```js
const { sanitizeUrl } = require('@braintree/sanitize-url');

const qs = require('querystringify');

const { renderPlaygroundPage } = require('graphql-playground-html');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
	const { endpoint } = qs.parse(req.url)
	res.html(renderPlaygroundPage({endpoint: sanitizeUrl(endpoint) })).status(200)
	next()
}
```

or, with `graphql-playground-express`:

```js
const { expressPlayground } = require('graphql-playground-middleware-express');
const { sanitizeUrl } = require('@braintree/sanitize-url');

const qs = require('querystringify');

const { renderPlaygroundPage } = require('graphql-playground-html');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
	const { endpoint } = qs.parse(req.url)
	res.html(expressPlayground({endpoint: sanitizeUrl(endpoint) })).status(200)
	next()
}
```

CVE-2020-4045,ssb-db,HIGH,Information disclosure in SSB-DB,"### Impact
_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

Servers running SSB-DB 20.0.0 (which is packaged with SSB-Server 16.0.0) must upgrade immediately.

**There is no evidence that other SSB apps are vulnerable or that this problem has been exploited in the wild.**

The `get()` method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there's a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it's returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around `get()` to anonymous peers.

### Patches
_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

Yes, please upgrade to SSB-DB 20.0.1 (or SSB-Server 16.0.1) immediately.

### Workarounds
_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

You may be able to disable the most obvious attack vector, SSB-OOO, by disabling the plugin, but you should upgrade immediately anyway.

CVE-2019-16775,npm,LOW,Arbitrary File Write in npm,"Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create files on a user's system when the package is installed. It is only possible to affect files that the user running `npm install` has access to and it is not possible to over write files that already exist on disk.

CVE-2019-16303,generator-jhipster-kotlin,CRITICAL,Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator in JHipster Kotlin,"JHipster Kotlin is using an insecure source of randomness to generate all of it's random values. JHipster Kotlin relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`.

From the documentation:

> Caveat: Instances of Random, upon which the implementation of this class relies, are not cryptographically secure.
> \- https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.9/org/apache/commons/lang3/RandomStringUtils.html

Here are the examples of JHipster Kotlin'ss use of an insecure PRNG:

https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/blob/193ae8f13c0be686f9687e78bacfedb144c47d8c/generators/server/templates/src/main/kotlin/package/service/util/RandomUtil.kt.ejs#L32

## Proof Of Concepts Already Exist

There has been a POC of taking one RNG value generated `RandomStringUtils` and reversing it to generate all of the past/future RNG values public since March 3rd, 2018.

https://medium.com/@alex91ar/the-java-soothsayer-a-practical-application-for-insecure-randomness-c67b0cd148cd

POC Repository: https://github.com/alex91ar/randomstringutils


## Potential Impact Technical

All that is required is to get one password reset token from a JHipster Kotlin generated service and using the POC above, you can reverse what all future password reset tokens to be generated by this server. This allows an attacker to pick and choose what account they would like to takeover by sending account password reset requests for targeted accounts.

## Potential Impact Scale

Not as large as for the original jhipster project as the kotlin blueprint is not that widely used.

### Patches

Update your generated applications to > 1.2.0

### Workarounds

Change the content of `RandomUtil.kt` like this:

```kotlin
import java.security.SecureRandom
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils

private const val DEF_COUNT = 20

object RandomUtil {
    private val secureRandom: SecureRandom = SecureRandom()

    init {
        secureRandom.nextBytes(byteArrayOf(64.toByte()))
    }

    private fun generateRandomAlphanumericString(): String {
        return RandomStringUtils.random(DEF_COUNT, 0, 0, true, true, null, secureRandom)
    }

    /**
    * Generate a password.
    *
    * @return the generated password.
    */
    fun generatePassword(): String = generateRandomAlphanumericString()
}
```

Important is to exchange **every** call of `RandomStringUtils.randomAlphaNumeric`.

CVE-2020-14966,jsrsasign,MODERATE,ECDSA signature validation vulnerability by accepting wrong ASN.1 encoding in jsrsasign,"### Impact
Jsrsasign supports ECDSA signature validation which signature value is represented by ASN.1 DER encoding. This vulnerablity may accept a wrong ASN.1 DER encoded ECDSA signature such as:

- wrong multi-byte ASN.1 length of TLV (ex. 0x820045 even though 0x45 is correct)
- prepending zeros with ASN.1 INTEGER value (ex. 0x00000123 even though 0x0123 is correct)
- appending zeros to signature of ASN.1 TLV (ex. 0x3082....1fbc000000 even though 0x3082....1fbc, appending zeros are ignored.)

This vulnerability was fixed by strict ASN.1 DER checking. 

Here is an assessment of this vulnerability:

- If you are not use ECDSA signature validation, this vulnerability is not affected.
- Not ASN.1 format signature like just concatenation of R and S value is not affected such as Bitcoin.
- This vulnerability is affected to all ECC curve parameters.
- Risk to accept a forged or crafted message to be signed is low.
- Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.
- ECDSA signatures semantically the same to valid one may be accepted as valid. There are many malleable variants.

As discussed [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/24862/ber-or-der-x9-62-for-ecdsa-signature), there is no standards like X9.62 which requires ASN.1 DER. So ASN.1 BER can be applied to ECDSA however most of implementations like OpenSSL do strict ASN.1 DER checking.

### Patches
Users using ECDSA signature validation should upgrade to 8.0.19.

### Workarounds

GHSA-g753-jx37-7xwh,jsrsasign,MODERATE,ECDSA signature vulnerability of Minerva timing attack in jsrsasign,"### Impact
ECDSA side-channel attack named [Minerava](https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/) have been found and it was found that it affects to jsrsasign.

Execution time of thousands signature generation have been observed then EC private key which is scalar value may be recovered since point and scalar multiplication time depends on bits of scalar. In jsrsasign 8.0.13 or later, execution time of EC point and scalar multiplication is almost constant and fixed for the issue.

- Minerva is one of timing attack or side channel attack for EC.
- If you don't use ECDSA class, you are not affected the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is that attacker may guess private key by checking processing time of EC key generation or ECDSA signing.
- The cause issue is that point multiplication processing time in ECDSA signing is depends on private key value.
- After 8.0.13, processing time of point multiplication in ECDSA signing have become constant for key value in theory.

### Patches
Users using ECDSA signature generation should upgrade to 8.0.13 or later.

### Workarounds
There is no workarounds in jsrsasign. Update jsrsasign or use other ECDSA library.

CVE-2020-15084,express-jwt,HIGH,Authorization bypass in express-jwt,"### Overview
Versions before and including 5.3.3, we are not enforcing the **algorithms** entry to be specified in the configuration.
When **algorithms** is not specified in the configuration, with the combination of jwks-rsa, it may lead to authorization bypass. 

### Am I affected?
You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

You are using express-jwt
AND 
You do not have **algorithms**  configured in your express-jwt configuration.
AND
You are using libraries such as jwks-rsa as the **secret**. 

### How to fix that?
Specify **algorithms** in the express-jwt configuration. The following is an example of a proper configuration

``` 
const checkJwt = jwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `https://${DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  }),
  // Validate the audience and the issuer.
  audience: process.env.AUDIENCE,
  issuer: `https://${DOMAIN}/`,
  // restrict allowed algorithms
  algorithms: ['RS256']
}); 
```

### Will this update impact my users?
The fix provided in patch will not affect your users if you specified the algorithms allowed. The patch now makes **algorithms** a required configuration.

CVE-2020-15092,@knight-lab/timelinejs,HIGH,Stored XSS in TimelineJS3,"### Impact
TimelineJS renders some user data as HTML. An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file.

Most TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document.

Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised.

Although the vulnerability has a [CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), this vulnerability has a severity of Moderate due to the likeliness of exploitation.

### Patches
Version 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. 

1. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is ""sanitized"" before being added to the DOM.
1. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped. 

Very few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to ""pin"" their timeline to an earlier version of the code.

Some users of TimelineJS use it as a part of a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/knight-lab-timelinejs/). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.

### Workarounds
To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have write access to the data source for the Timeline or the server which embeds the timeline.

Thus, the only workaround is appropriate attention to securing write access to the Google Sheet or JSON file which serves as the data source.

### References

GHSA-7xcx-6wjh-7xp2,standard-version,MODERATE,Command Injection in standard-version,"# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2020-111`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).

## Summary

The `standardVersion` function has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the `standard-version` library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.

## Product
Standard Version
 
## Tested Version
Commit [2f04ac8](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version/tree/2f04ac8fc1c134a1981c23a093d4eece77d0bbb9/)

## Details

### Issue 1: Command injection in `standardVersion`

The following proof-of-concept illustrates the vulnerability. First install Standard Version and create an empty git repo to run the PoC in:

```
npm install standard-version
git init
echo ""foo"" > foo.txt # the git repo has to be non-empty
git add foo.txt
git commit -am ""initial commit""
```

Now create a file with the following contents:

```
var fs = require(""fs"");
// setting up a bit of environment
fs.writeFileSync(""package.json"", '{""name"": ""foo"", ""version"": ""1.0.0""}');

const standardVersion = require('standard-version')

standardVersion({
  noVerify: true,
  infile: 'foo.txt',
  releaseCommitMessageFormat: ""bla `touch exploit`""
})
```

and run it:

```
node test.js
```

Notice that a file named `exploit` has been created.

This vulnerability is similar to command injection vulnerabilities that have been found in other Javascript libraries. Here are some examples:

We have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query on the `standard-version` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/237522640229151035/).

#### Impact

This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input.

#### Remediation

We recommend not using an API that can interpret a string as a shell command. For example, use [`child_process.execFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) instead of [`child_process.exec`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

CVE-2020-15123,codecov,MODERATE,Command injection in codecov (npm package),"### Impact

The `upload` method has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the `codecov-node` library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.

A similar CVE was issued: [CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh), but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked `&`, and command injection is still possible using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer.

We have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query on the `codecov-node` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/7714424068617023832/).


### Patches
This has been patched in version 3.7.1

### Workarounds

None, however, the attack surface is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the module is used directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in another application that may supply malicious input and perform command injection.

We believe this is the only time that password is stored at all. In the documentation under Users > Signing Up, it clearly states, ""We never store passwords in plaintext, nor will we ever transmit passwords back to the client in plaintext.""

Example Code:
```js
async () => {

    if (user) {
        user.setPassword('newpass')

    }
}
```
After running the above code, the new password will be stored in localStorage as a property named ""password"".

Proposed Solution:
Before saving anything to localStorage, Parse should strip out any properties named ""password"" that are attempting to be stored with a Parse.User type object.

CVE-2020-15135,save-server,MODERATE,CSRF vulnerability in save-server,"### Impact
Versions prior to version v1.05 are affected by a CSRF vulnerability, as there is no CSRF mitigation (Tokens etc.). The fix introduced in version v1.05 unintentionally breaks uploading so version v1.0.7 is the fixed version.

This is patched by implementing [Double submit](https://medium.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/double-submit-cookie-pattern-65bb71d80d9f).

The CSRF attack would require you to navigate to a malicious site while you have an active session with Save-Server (Session key stored in cookies). The malicious user would then be able to perform some actions, including:
- Upload file
- Delete file
- Add redirect


#### If you are logged in as root, this attack is significantly more severe. They can (in addition to the above):
- Create users
- Delete users
- Update users (change password)

If they updated the password of a user, that user's files would then be available. If the root password is updated, all files would be visible if they logged in with the new password.

Note that due to the same origin policy malicious actors cannot view the gallery or the response of any of the methods, nor be sure they succeeded. 
### Patches
This issue has been patched. Update to version v1.0.7 or above to benefit from this fix.

### Workarounds
None. You should upgrade.

GHSA-5cp4-xmrw-59wf,angular,MODERATE,XSS via JQLite DOM manipulation functions in AngularJS,"### Summary
XSS may be triggered in AngularJS applications that sanitize user-controlled HTML snippets before passing them to `JQLite` methods like `JQLite.prepend`, `JQLite.after`, `JQLite.append`, `JQLite.replaceWith`, `JQLite.append`, `new JQLite` and `angular.element`.

### Description

JQLite (DOM manipulation library that's part of AngularJS) manipulates input HTML before inserting it to the DOM in `jqLiteBuildFragment`.

One of the modifications performed [expands an XHTML self-closing tag](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/418355f1cf9a9a9827ae81d257966e6acfb5623a/src/jqLite.js#L218).

If `jqLiteBuildFragment` is called (e.g. via `new JQLite(aString)`) with user-controlled HTML string that was sanitized (e.g. with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)), the transformation done by JQLite may modify some forms of an inert, sanitized payload into a payload containing JavaScript - and trigger an XSS when the payload is inserted into DOM.

This is similar to a bug in jQuery `htmlPrefilter` function that was [fixed in 3.5.0](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/).

### Proof of concept

```javascript
const inertPayload = `<div><style><style/><img src=x onerror=""alert(1337)""/>` 
```
Note that the style element is not closed and `<img` would be a text node inside the style if inserted into the DOM as-is.
As such, some HTML sanitizers would leave the `<img` as is without processing it and stripping the `onerror` attribute.

```javascript
angular.element(document).append(inertPayload);
```
This will alert, as `<style/>` will be replaced with `<style></style>` before adding it to the DOM, closing the style element early and reactivating `img`.

### Patches
The issue is patched in `JQLite` bundled with angular 1.8.0. AngularJS users using JQuery should upgrade JQuery to 3.5.0, as a similar vulnerability [affects jQuery <3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2).

### Workarounds
Changing sanitizer configuration not to allow certain tag grouping (e.g. `<option><style></option>`) or inline style elements may stop certain exploitation vectors, but it's uncertain if all possible exploitation vectors would be covered. Upgrade of AngularJS to 1.8.0 is recommended.",2020-08-05T21:47:02Z,< 1.8.0,1.8.0

This impacts all Safari and Internet Explorer users of Prism >=v1.1.0 that use the _Previewers_ plugin (>=v1.10.0) or the _Previewer: Easing_ plugin (v1.1.0 to v1.9.0).

### Patches
This problem is patched in v1.21.0.

### Workarounds
To workaround the issue without upgrading, [disable the easing preview](https://prismjs.com/plugins/previewers/#disabling-a-previewer) on all impacted code blocks. You need Prism v1.10.0 or newer to apply this workaround.

CVE-2020-15119,auth0-lock,LOW,DOM-based XSS in auth0-lock,"### Overview
Versions before and including `11.25.1` are using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to display an informational message when used with a Passwordless or Enterprise connection.

- For Passwordless connection, the value of the input (email or phone number) is displayed back to the user while waiting for verification code input.  
- For Enterprise connection, the value of the input (IdP Domain) from the Enterprise connection setup screen (Auth0 Dashboard) is displayed back to the user when the `lock` widget opens.

When Passwordless or Enterprise connection is used, the application and its users might be exposed to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Am I affected?
You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

- You are using auth0-lock
- You are using Passwordless or Enterprise connection mode

### How to fix that?
Upgrade to version `11.26.3`

### Will this update impact my users?
The fix provided in patch will not affect your users.

GHSA-r587-7jh2-4qr3,flood,CRITICAL,Server secret was included in static assets and served to clients,"### Impact
Server JWT signing secret was included in static assets and served to clients.

This ALLOWS Flood's builtin authentication to be bypassed. Given Flood is granted access to rTorrent's SCGI interface (which is unprotected and ALLOWS arbitrary code execution) and usually wide-ranging privileges to files, along with Flood's lack of security controls against authenticated users, the severity of this vulnerability is **CRITICAL**. 

### Background
Commit 8d11640b imported `config.js` to client (frontend) components to get `disableUsersAndAuth` configuration variable. Subsequently contents of `config.js` are compiled into static assets and served to users. Unfortunately `config.js` also includes `secret`.

Intruders can use `secret` to sign authentication tokens themselves to bypass builtin access control of Flood.

### Patches
Commit 042cb4ce removed imports of `config.js` from client (frontend) components. Additionally an eslint rule was added to prevent config.js from being imported to client (frontend) components.

Commit 103f53c8 provided a general mitigation to this kind of problem by searching static assets to ensure `secret` is not included before starting server (backend). 

### Workarounds
Users shall upgrade if they use Flood's builtin authentication system.

While maintainers will do their best to support it, Flood cannot guarantee its in-house access control system can stand against determined attackers in high-stake environments. 

> Use `HTTP Basic Auth` or other battle-hardened authentication methods instead of Flood's in-house one. You can use `disableUsersAndAuth` to avoid duplicate authentication.

Users are advised to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki) for more information on security precautions.

CVE-2013-7379,tomato,CRITICAL,API Admin Auth Weakness in tomato,"Versions of `tomato` prior to 0.0.6 are affected by a somewhat complex authentication bypass vulnerability in the admin service when only a single access key is configured on the server. The vulnerability allows an attacker to guess the password for the admin service, no matter how complex that password is, in less than 200 requests.


## Details
The tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an `access_key` in the config options. This `access_key` is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.


Tomato verifies the `access_key` by checking to see if the server `access_key` incorporates the user provided value at any location. This allows an attacker to provide a single character as an `access_key`, and so long as the server key contains at least one instance of that character it will be considered a valid key.

## Proof of Concept
This is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.

```
if (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {
```

For an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.

```

## Recommendation

At the time of this writing, February 2018, all versions of `ansi2html` remain vulnerable, and the package has not been updated for 4 years. 

In order to use this package safely, it is necessary to avoid passing user input to the package, or to limit the size of the input string to a size with a parse time you find acceptable. Unfortunately, the match time grows at quite a small character count, so it is unlikely for it to both allow strings of a useful size while protecting against the denial of service attack. 

In the case that user input of significant length must be parsed by ansi2html, the best mitigation is to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality. There are [multiple modules fitting this criteria available on npm.][available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ansi+html)",2020-09-01T15:17:48Z,>= 0.0.0,

CVE-2016-10519,bittorrent-dht,MODERATE,Remote Memory Disclosure in bittorrent-dht,"Versions of `bittorrent-dht` prior to 5.1.3 are affected by a remote memory disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send a specific series of of messages to a listening peer and get it to reveal internal memory.


There are two mitigating factors here, that slightly reduce the impact of this vulnerability:

1. Any modern kernel will zero out new memory pages before handing them off to a process. This means that only memory previously used and deallocated by the node process can be leaked.
1. Node.js manages Buffers by creating a few large internal SlowBuffers, and slicing them up into smaller Buffers which are made accessible in JS. They are not stored on V8's heap, because garbage collection would interfere. The result is that only memory that has been previously allocated as a Buffer can be leaked.


## Recommendation

Update to version 5.1.3 or later.",2020-09-01T15:22:12Z,< 5.1.3,5.1.3

## Recommendation

This package is not actively maintained, and has not seen an update since 2015. 

Because of this, the simplest mitigation is to avoid using the `itemTitle` parameter. With over 200 open issues and over 100 open pull requests as of 2/2018, it seems unlikely that the author has any intention of maintaining the module. If avoiding the use of `itemTitle` indefinitely is acceptable, this is a workable solution. If not, the best available mitigation is to use a fork of the module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality.

The text content of these labels is not escaped, so if control over the labels is obtained, script can be injected. The script will run on the client side whenever that specific graph is loaded.


## Recommendation

A patch for this vulnerability was created in 2014, but has still not been published to npm. In order to mitigate this issue effectively, install the library from github via:

## Recommendation

There is currently no direct patch for `sync-exec`, as the `child_process.execSync` function provided in Node.js v0.12.0 and later provides the same functionality natively.

## Recommendation

There is no direct patch for this issue. The package author has reviewed this advisory, and provided the following recommendation:

```
To avoid the security issues, at least one of the following methods should be taken:

1. Make sure to send serialized strings internally, isolating them from potential hackers. For example, only sending the strings from backend to fronend and always using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

2. Introduce public-key cryptosystems (e.g. RSA) to ensure the strings not being tampered with.

This module runs an encrypted payload targeting a very specific application, `copay` and because they shared the same description it would have likely worked for `copay-dash`.

The injected code:

- Read in AES encrypted data from a file disguised as a test fixture
- Grabbed the npm package description of the module that imported it, using an automatically set environment variable
- Used the package description as a key to decrypt a chunk of data pulled in from the disguised file

The decrypted data was part of a module, which was then compiled in memory and executed.

This module performed the following actions:

- Decrypted another chunk of data from the disguised file
- Concatenated a small, commented prefix from the first decrypted chunk to the end of the second decrypted chunk
- Performed minor decoding tasks to transform the concatenated block of code from invalid JS to valid JS (we believe this was done to evade detection by dynamic analysis tools)
- Wrote this processed block of JS out to a file stored in a dependency that would be packaged by the build scripts: 

The chunk of code that was written out was the actual malicious code, intended to be run on devices owned by the end users of Copay.

This code would do the following:

- Detect the current environment: Mobile/Cordova/Electron
- Check the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash balances on the victim's copay account
- If the current balance was greater than 100 Bitcoin, or 1000 Bitcoin Cash:
  - Harvest the victim's account data in full
  - Harvest the victim's copay private keys

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts users who rely on the for last digits of personnummer to be a _real_ personnummer.  

### Patches

The issue have been patched in all repositories. The following versions should be updated to as soon as possible:

C# 3.0.2  
D 3.0.1  
Dart 3.0.3  
Elixir 3.0.0

Python 3.0.2  
Ruby 3.0.1  
Rust 3.0.0  
Scala 3.0.1  
Swift 1.0.1  

If you are using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.

### Workarounds

The issue arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits of the personnummer to be
000, which is invalid. To mitigate this without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's not
000x.

CVE-2020-15168,node-fetch,LOW,The `size` option isn't honored after following a redirect in node-fetch,"### Impact
Node Fetch did not honor the `size` option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a `FetchError` would never get thrown and the process would end without failure.

For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after `fetch()` has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.

### Patches
We released patched versions for both stable and beta channels:

- For `v2`: 2.6.1

### Patches
The issue is patched in version 1.0.1 by improving the regular expression used and also enforcing a 254 character limit.

CVE-2020-15256,object-path,HIGH,Prototype pollution in object-path,"### Impact
A prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` <= 0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable.
 
### Patches
Upgrade to version >= 0.11.5

### Workarounds
Don't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.

CVE-2020-15270,parse-server,MODERATE,receiving subscription objects with deleted session,"Original Message:
Hi,

I create objects with one client with an ACL of all users with a specific column value. Thats working so far.

Then I deleted the session object from one user to look if he can receive subscription objects and he can receive them.
The client with the deleted session cant create new objects, which Parse restricts right.

The LiveQueryServer doesnt detect deleted sessions after the websocket connection was established.
There should be a mechanism that checks in an specific interval if the session exists.
I dont know if its true with expired sessions.

Any solutions?

Parse version: 4.3.0
Parse js SDK version: 2.17

Solution:
Hi guys.

I've found and fixed the problem. It happens because there are two caches in place for the session token:

- at Parse Server level, which, according with the docs, should be changed via cacheTTL option and defaults to 5 seconds;
- at Parse Live Query level, which, according with the docs, should be changed via liveQueryServerOptions.cacheTimeout and defaults to 30 days.

But there are three problems:

- cacheTTL has currently no effect over Live Query Server;
- cacheTimeout also has currently no effect over Live Query Server;
- cacheTimeout actually defaults to 1h.

So, currently, if you wait 1 hour after the session token was invalidated, the clients using the old session token are not able to receive the events.

What I did:

- Added a test case for the problem;
- Fixed cacheTTL for Live Query Server;
- Fixed cacheTimeout for Live Query Server;
- Changed the cacheTimeout to default 5s;
- Changed the docs to reflect the actual 5s default for cacheTimeout.",2020-10-27T19:15:19Z,<= 4.3.0,

If are you are using Highlight.js to highlight user-provided data you are possibly vulnerable.  On the client-side (in a browser or Electron environment) risks could include lengthy freezes or crashes... On the server-side infinite freezes could occur... effectively preventing users from accessing your app or service (ie, Denial of Service).

This is an issue with grammars shipped with the parser (and potentially 3rd party grammars also), not the parser itself. If you are using Highlight.js with any of the following grammars you are vulnerable.  If you are using `highlightAuto` to detect the language (and have any of these grammars registered) you are vulnerable.

All versions prior to 10.4.1 are vulnerable, including version 9.18.5.

  - javascript & typescript (10.4.0 included partial fixes)

And of course any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `hpp` is no safer than `cpp`.

**Grammars with polynomial backtracking issues:**

CVE-2020-6506,react-native-webview,HIGH,Universal XSS in Android WebView,"A universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) vulnerability, CVE-2020-6506 (https://crbug.com/1083819), has been identified in the Android WebView system component, which allows cross-origin iframes to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the top-level document. This vulnerability affects React Native apps which use a `react-native-webview` that allows navigation to arbitrary URLs, and when that app runs on systems with an Android WebView version prior to 83.0.4103.106.

## Mitigation

react-native-webview 11.0.0+ has introduced a new prop to mitigate this issue.  Updating to a later version is recommended.

CVE-2020-7788,ini,LOW,Prototype Pollution,"### Overview
The `ini` npm package before version 1.3.6 has a Prototype Pollution vulnerability.

If an attacker submits a malicious INI file to an application that parses it with `ini.parse`, they will pollute the prototype on the application. This can be exploited further depending on the context.

This has been patched in 1.3.6

### Steps to reproduce

payload.ini
```
[__proto__]
polluted = ""polluted""
```

poc.js:
```
var fs = require('fs')
var ini = require('ini')

var parsed = ini.parse(fs.readFileSync('./payload.ini', 'utf-8'))
console.log(parsed)
console.log(parsed.__proto__)
console.log(polluted)

If using affected versions to determine a URL's hostname, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.

Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

Example URL: `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com`
Escaped string: `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com` (JavaScript strings must escape backslash)

Affected versions incorrectly return `observed-example.com`. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the [WHATWG URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/), including web browsers and [Node's built-in URL class](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).

GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65,tinymce,MODERATE,Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE,"### Impact
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the URL sanitization logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.5.1 or lower.

### Patches
This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.6.0 by improved URL sanitization logic.

### Workarounds
To work around this vulnerability, either:
- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.6.0 or higher
- Manually sanitize `iframe`, `object` and `embed` URL attributes using a [TinyMCE node filter](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.domparser/#addnodefilter).
- Disable `iframe`, `object`, and `embed` elements in your content using the [invalid_elements](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/content-filtering/#invalid_elements) setting.

#### Example: Sanitizing using a node filter
```js
editor.parser.addNodeFilter('iframe,object,embed', function(nodes) {
  nodes.forEach(function(node) {
    if (node.attributes) {
      node.attributes.forEach(function(attr) {
        var name = attr.name;
        var value = attr.value;
        // Sanitize the attribute value here or remove it entirely
        var sanitizedValue = ...;
        node.attr(name, santizedValue);
      });
    }
  });
});
```

#### Example: Using invalid_elements
```js
invalid_elements: 'iframe,object,embed'
```

The FTP protocol creates two connections, one for commands and one for transferring data.
This second data connection can be created in two ways, on the server by sending the PASV command, or on the client by sending the PORT command.

The PORT command sends the IP and port for the server to connect to the client with.

### Issue
Since the client can send an arbitrary IP with the PORT command, this can be used to cause the server to make a connection elsewhere.

### Patches

Deprecation notices have been published for older versions.

CVE-2021-21316,less-openui5,HIGH,Processing untrusted theming resources might execute arbitrary code (ACE),"### Impact
When processing theming resources (i.e. `*.less` files) with less-openui5 that originate from an untrusted source, those resources might contain JavaScript code which will be executed in the context of the build process.

While this is a [feature](http://lesscss.org/usage/#less-options-enable-inline-javascript-deprecated-) of the [Less.js library](https://github.com/less/less.js), it is an unexpected behavior in the context of OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 development.

Especially in the context of [UI5 Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling), which relies on less-openui5, this poses a security threat:

An attacker might create a [library](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Builder/#library) or [theme-library](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Builder/#theme-library) containing a custom control or theme, hiding malicious JavaScript code in one of the `.less` files.

This is an example of inline JavaScript in a Less file:
```less
.rule {
	@var: `(function(){console.log('Hello from JavaScript'); process.exit(1);})()`;
	color: @var;
}
```

Starting with Less.js version 3.0.0, the Inline JavaScript feature is disabled by default. less-openui5 however currently uses [a fork](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/tree/master/lib/thirdparty/less) of Less.js v1.6.3.

Note that disabling the Inline JavaScript feature in Less.js versions 1.x, still evaluates code has additional double codes around it:
```less
.rule {
	@var: ""`(function(){console.log('Hello from JavaScript'); process.exit(1);})()`"";
	color: @var;
}
```

### Patches
We decided to remove the inline JavaScript evaluation feature completely from the code of our Less.js fork.

This fix is available in less-openui5 version [v0.10.0](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/releases/tag/v0.10.0)

### Workarounds
Only process trusted theming resources.

CVE-2021-21254,@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm,LOW,Regular expression Denial of Service in Markdown plugin,"### Impact
A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability has been discovered in the CKEditor 5 Markdown plugin code. The vulnerability allowed to abuse a link recognition regular expression, which could cause a significant performance drop resulting in a browser tab freeze. It affects all users using the CKEditor 5 Markdown plugin at version <= 24.0.0. 

### Patches
The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix will be available in version 25.0.0.

### Workarounds
The user can work around the issue by:
- Upgrading CKEditor 5 to version 25.0.0.
- Disabling the Markdown plugin.

CVE-2021-21277,angular-expressions,LOW,Angular Expressions - Remote Code Execution,"### Impact

The vulnerability, reported by GoSecure Inc, allows Remote Code Execution, if you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input.

This time, the security of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload, using a `.constructor.constructor` technique.

* If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
* If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 1.1.2 of angular-expressions

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround might be either to : 

* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application

OR

* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput : 

```js
if (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :""'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {
      var result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);
}
else {
     result = undefined;
}

Clients of FTP servers utilizing `ftp-srv` hosted on Windows machines can escape the  FTP user's defined root folder using the expected FTP commands, for example, `CWD` and `UPDR`.

### Background

When windows separators exist within the path (`\`), `path.resolve` leaves the upper pointers intact and allows the user to move beyond the root folder defined for that user. We did not take that into account when creating the path resolve function.

CVE-2021-21310,next-auth,LOW,Token verification bug in next-auth,"### Impact

Implementations using the **Prisma database adapter** with the **Email provider** **are impacted**.

Implementations using the Prisma database adapter that are not using the Email provider are not impacted.
Implementations using the default database adapter (TypeORM) with the Email provider are not impacted.
Implementations not using a database are not impacted.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in 3.3.0 and newer versions.

### Workarounds

Those not able to upgrade can alternatively disable the Email provider as a workaround.

### Description

The Prisma database adapter was checking the verification token but not the identifier (the email address associated with the token). This made it possible to use a valid token assigned to one user, to sign in as another user when using the Prima adapter in conjunction with the Email provider. The defect is specific to the community-supported Prisma database adapter in versions <3.3.0 and is not present in the default database adapter (TypeORM).

*Note:  The current community-supported adapter was not developed by Prisma.*

The defect was a problem in the implementation of verification function the adapter and is not directly related to Prisma.

The flaw may exist in other third party database adapters that do not check both the identifier and token values.

The design of the database adapter API may be revised in future to help reduce the likelyhood of similar defects.

### Timeline

On Monday (2021-02-08) we were notified via responsible disclosure by Alessandro Angelino (@AlessandroA) of a flaw in the implementation of the Prisma database adapter included with NextAuth.js. A detailed write up and proof of concept were provided.

The following day (2021-02-09) we published a fix in v3.3.0 and confirmed through internal testing, and with Alessandro, that the issue was resolved in the new release and prompted users to upgrade.

On 2021-02-10 we received a CVE ID and published this advisory within a few hours of notification.

We would like to thank Alessandro for using responsible disclose to allow us to address the issue promptly and publish this advisory once an update was available that resolved the issue and Balázs Orbán (@balazsorban44) for facilitating a timely release of the fix.",2021-02-11T21:36:24Z,< 3.3.0,3.3.0

CVE-2021-27516,urijs,MODERATE,Hostname spoofing via backslashes in URL,"### Impact
If using affected versions to determine a URL's hostname, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character as part of the scheme delimiter, e.g. `scheme:/\hostname`. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.

Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

Example URL: `https:/\expected-example.com/path`
Escaped string: `https:/\\expected-example.com/path` (JavaScript strings must escape backslash)

Affected versions incorrectly return no hostname. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the [WHATWG URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/), including web browsers and [Node's built-in URL class](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).

GHSA-xmh9-rg6f-j3mr,@solid/identity-token-verifier,MODERATE,Verification flaw in Solid identity-token-verifier,"### Impact
#### Severity
Any Pod on a Solid server using a vulnerable version of the identity-token-verifier library is at risk of a spoofed Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) token binding. This vulnerability could give total and complete access to a targeted Pod.

#### Summary
A verification flaw in the implementation of the identity token verifier library (https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier) allows DPoP proofs to be spoofed. 

DPoP proofs are used to bind access tokens to a private key meant to be in sole possession of a specific user. Instead of verifying against the hash of an embedded public key, the library instead verifies against a field that an attacker can modify to spoof another user’s DPoP. 

A stolen DPoP proof, when used in the right context, therefore allows the rebinding of a DPoP-bound access token. Any attacker in possession of a targeted access token could build an attack environment to replay it on any Pod service with this vulnerability.  


### Patches
A new version 0.5.2 of identity-token-verifier fixes the verification: https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier/blob/7e18d86d65ee681e8ae912b6a032a1bae3cae570/src/lib/DPoP.ts#L25-L35

CVE-2021-21368,msgpack5,MODERATE,Prototype poisoning,"### Impact

The issue is as follows: when `msgpack5` decodes a map containing a 
key `""__proto__""`, it assigns the decoded value to `__proto__`. As you 
are no doubt aware, `Object.prototype.__proto__` is an accessor 
property for the receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to 
the key `__proto__` decodes to an object or `null`, `msgpack5` sets 
the decoded object's prototype to that value. 

An attacker who can submit crafted MessagePack data to a service can 
use this to produce values that appear to be of other types; may have 
unexpected prototype properties and methods (for example `length`, 
numeric properties, and `push` et al if `__proto__`'s value decodes to 
an `Array`); and/or may throw unexpected exceptions when used (for 
example if the `__proto__` value decodes to a `Map` or `Date`). Other 
unexpected behavior might be produced for other types. 

There is no effect on the global prototype.

An example: 

```js 
const msgpack5 = require('msgpack5')(); 

const payload = {}; 
Object.defineProperty(payload, '__proto__', { 
value: new Map().set(1, 2), 
enumerable: true 
}); 

const encoded = msgpack5.encode(payload); 
console.log(encoded); // <Buffer 81 a9 5f 5f 70 72 6f 74 6f 5f 5f 81 01 02> 

const decoded = msgpack5.decode(encoded); 

// decoded's prototype has been overwritten 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded)); // Map(1) { 1 => 2 } 
console.log(decoded.get); // [Function: get] 

// decoded appears to most common typechecks to be a Map 
console.log(decoded instanceof Map); // true 
console.log(decoded.toString()); // [object Map] 
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(decoded)); // [object Map] 
console.log(decoded.constructor.name); // Map 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded).constructor.name); // Map 

// decoded is not, however, a Map 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded) === Map.prototype); // false 

// using decoded as though it were a Map throws 
try { 
decoded.get(1); 
} catch (error) { 
console.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.get called 
// on incompatible receiver #<Map> 
} 
try { 
decoded.size; 
} catch (error) { 
console.log(error); // TypeError: Method get Map.prototype.size 
// called on incompatible receiver #<Map> 
} 

// re-encoding the decoded value throws 
try { 
msgpack5.encode(decoded); 
} catch (error) { 
console.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.entries 
// called on incompatible receiver #<Map> 
} 
``` 

This ""prototype poisoning"" is sort of a very limited inversion of a 
prototype pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is 
affected, and it can only be set to `msgpack5` values (though if the 
victim makes use of custom codecs, anything could be a `msgpack5` 
value). We have not found a way to escalate this to true prototype 
pollution (absent other bugs in the consumer's code). 

### Patches

GHSA-hfwx-c7q6-g54c,highcharts-export-server,HIGH,Vulnerability allowing for reading internal HTTP resources,"### Impact

The vulnerability allows for reading and outputting files served by other services on the internal network in which the export server is hosted. If the export server is exposed to the internet, this potentially allows a malicious user to gain read access to internal web-resources.

The impact is limited to internal services that serve content via. HTTP(S), and requires the attacker to know internal hostnames/IP addresses.

The previous versions have been marked as deprecated on NPM.

### Patches

Version 2.1.0 released alongside this security advisory addresses the issue. **Please note that this release is not backwards compatible out of the box. See the [changelog](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.**

Additionally, it's also recommended to upgrade to the latest version of Highcharts to get the added input sanitation implemented in version 9.0 and later. 

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds to the issue - an upgrade to version 2.1.0 is required.

CVE-2021-21384,shescape,HIGH,Null characters not escaped,"### Impact

Anyone using _Shescape_ to defend against shell injection may still be vulnerable against shell injection if the attacker manages to insert a [null character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character) into the payload. For example (on Windows):

```javascript
const cp = require(""child_process"");
const shescape = require(""shescape"");

const nullChar = String.fromCharCode(0);
const payload = ""foo\"" && ls -al ${nullChar} && echo \""bar"";
console.log(cp.execSync(`echo ${shescape.quote(payload)}`));
// foototal 3
// drwxr-xr-x 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 18:44 .
// drwxr-xr-x 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 00:09 ..
// drwxr-xr-x 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 18:42 folder                                                                 
// -rw-r--r-- 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 18:42 file
```

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [v1.1.3](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.1.3) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.

### Workarounds

Alternatively, null characters can be stripped out manually using e.g. `arg.replace(/\u{0}/gu, """")`",2021-03-18T23:47:56Z,< 1.1.3,1.1.3
